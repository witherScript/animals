Animal Shelter Website
Now is your turn to practice with inheritance and cascading styles.

Create a new web page for an animal shelter. 

List out the animals available to be adopted,

including pictures and descriptions of each animal. 

Have at least 3-5 animals listed. 

Don't forget to set up a git repository, make frequent commits and push to a remote repository on GitHub.
Display each animal's "profile" in a column.

Change the styles of elements nested within the columns using the idea of cascading.

Find other places in your web pages where you can change elements on the page according to cascading precedence.

Center some elements on the page.


Title at the top (centered) <h1></h1>

unordered list with 3 li elements styled as columns
  within each li element:
    - A picture <img src='' alt=''>
    - Description <p></p>

commit timeline:
1. making the blank files
2. writing the header element and list element content 
3. including the css styling to display the list elements in columns
